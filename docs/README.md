# Overview

Welcome to botodocs! This site serves as the boto3 reference for its features.

These include the boto3:
- clients
- resources
- sub-resources
- waiters
- paginators
- collections

_and all data types that they use_.

It has been designed for better usability than the official docs, namely by providing:
- make service pages less dense
- copy-pastable snippets covering the various boto3 features
- offline search

This site is automatically deployed every 3 days so you should see full feature coverage here.

Note that the official boto3 guides have been left out and you should consult the official website for that:
